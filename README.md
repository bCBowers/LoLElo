This model builds on three years of professional League of Legends results from several top leagues (provided here: http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/) to build an Elo model of teams. Similar to club soccer and other international competitions, it is difficult to compare club teams across different leagues because they rarely play head-to-head. An Elo model can help properly account for the relative strengths of different teams and leagues.

The model is being used to predict the 2018 League of Legends World Championships for StatXP and is described in further detail here: https://www.statxp.com/thelatest/2018/10/6/who-will-win-lol-worlds-2018. Daily updates driven by this model can also be found on www.statxp.com.
