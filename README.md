This model builds on three years of professional League of Legends results from several top leagues (provided here: http://oracleselixir.com/match-data/) to build an Elo model of teams. Similar to club soccer and other international competitions, it is difficult to compare club teams across different leagues because they rarely play head-to-head. An Elo model can help properly account for the relative strengths of different teams and leagues.

This model is currently under development and is being tested during the ongoing LoL World Championships.
